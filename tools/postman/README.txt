## API smoke tests (Postman + Newman)

This repo includes a Postman collection and environment for quick end-to-end API checks, runnable via Newman.

### Files
- Collection: `tools/postman/FitnessBooking.Api - v1.postman_collection.json`
- Environment: `tools/postman/FitnessBooking Local.postman_environment.json`
- Runner script: `tools/postman/run-newman.ps1`

> Note: `tools/postman/after_run_environment.json` is generated by Newman and is ignored by git.

### Prerequisites
- The API must be running locally (default base URL: `http://localhost:5039`).
- Node.js + Newman installed (Newman is run as `newman.cmd` to avoid PowerShell script policy issues).

### Start the API
From repo root:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\src\FitnessBooking.Api\FitnessBooking.Api.csproj
